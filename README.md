# Hi! 👋 I am Azeem. 🙂

Welcome to my [GitHub](https://github.com/iamAzeem) profile!

I am a Software Engineer. 🤓  
I write code to build software to solve technical problems.

I am an autodidact polymath and polyglot.  
I write code in languages such as C, C++, Ruby, Python, Golang, etc.  
However, I love C++ the most! ❤️

I contribute to
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7670262/azeem?tab=profile) and
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/az33msajid/) whenever I get a chance.

I also do freelance software development. 💻  
Contact me if you want me to write code for a project. ⌨️
