# Hi there! 👋

I am Azeem! 😄

I am a Software Engineer.
I write code to build software to solve technical problems.

I am an autodidact polymath and polyglot.
I write code in many languages such as C, C++, Ruby, Python, Golang, etc.  
But, I *love* C++ the most. ❤️

I contribute to StackOverflow and LinkedIn whenever I get a chance.

And, I also do freelance work. 💻

Here are some of my favorite quotations:

On *knowledge and learning*:

> "I know one thing; that I know nothing."
> ― *Socrates*

On *planning, management, and execution*:

> "Poor planning on your part does not necessitate an emergency on mine."
> ― *Bob Carter*

Alternative version:

> "Your lack of planning is not my emergency."

On *destiny*:

> "Destiny is no matter of chance. It is a matter of choice.
> It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved."
> ― *William Jennings Bryan*
